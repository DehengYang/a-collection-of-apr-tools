# A Collection of Automated Program Repair (APR) Tools

We have collected a list of APR tools since 2008 in this repository. For each APR tool, we have attached the following metadata:
1. Publication Title
2. Publication Year 
3. Publication Venue
4. Link 
5. Target Language
6. Evaluated Dataset
7. CCF Rank

We hope it could serve as a good reference point for APR researchers who would like to get a complete list of APR tools and newcomers who are interested in APR.

## The Way to Contribute to this Repository

To contribute to this repository, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

### Step 2: Configure the Python Environment

1. `cd metadata_manager`
2. `conda env create -f env.yml`
3. `conda activate apr-tools`
4. `python main_json_generator.py`,

and then you will see the following Window:

![./doc/ui.png](./doc/ui.png)


First, paste the Bibtex data of the paper you want to add, and click "Start Parsing". Then, fill the corresponding fields (e.g., APR tool name, Specification) of the paper in the UI. Finally, click "Save As JSON" to add the paper metadata to the output directory (i.e., `output/json_new`). 

5. `python main_json_parser.py` to update the Markdown Table of the `README.md` file.

### Step 3: Create a PR 


## Update

We will continue updating the repository to include the latest APR tools. Any contribution is very welcomed :blush:!

The Excel version is available [here](./A_collection_of_apr_tools.xlsx).

The Markdown version is as follows:
