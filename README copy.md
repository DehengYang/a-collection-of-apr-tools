# A Collection of Automated Program Repair (APR) Tools

We have collected a list of APR tools since 2008 in this repository. For each APR tool, we have attached the following metadata:
1. Publication Title
2. Publication Year 
3. Publication Venue
4. Link 
5. Target Language
6. Evaluated Dataset
7. CCF Rank

We hope it could serve as a good reference point for APR researchers who would like to get a complete list of APR tools and newcomers who are interested in APR.

## Update

We will continue updating the repository to include the latest APR tools. Any contribution is very welcomed :blush:!

The Excel version is available [here](./A_collection_of_apr_tools.xlsx).

The Markdown version is as follows:
